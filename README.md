## [V3 of TaxiStats Website](https://leobennett85.github.io/TaxiStats/v3/index.html)

### Project Description:

To record and display live statistics of a Driver's taxi shift. Including expenses for the Broker (owner of the car) and the driver. Features include:
<ul>
<li>Estimated cost of Gas</li>
<li>Live Profit report</li>
<li>A map report of runs completed (referencing API LEAFLET.js)</li>
<li>Data Views that display collected information in useful manners</li>
</ul>

### Motivation

Having driven for Jiffy Cabs for 5 years, I was always quite surprised at my bottom line disappearing during my shift. On top of that, I always wished we had a tool that could show where and when your best profits would come. Writing this down was a hassle and to know what you really made would take a minute of recalculation every check. This was tool built completely from the driver's perspective.

### Challenges

I have built in 2 challenges for myself on this project
<br>**Challenge 1** - No Graphics. Everything on the site had to be built in CSS, Javascript and HTML
<br>**Challenge 2** - To create an object oriented library for scalability of project
